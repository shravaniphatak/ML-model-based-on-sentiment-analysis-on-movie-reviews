B] Introduction: We are TML-02 and our ML model is based on sentiment Analysis of movie reviews(i.e positive, negative) using NLP(Natural Language processing)

C] Data set Description: our Dataset consists of two columns one for reviews and one for sentiments and has total 50,000 reviews and its corresponding sentiments 25000 of which are positive and 25000 are negative

D] dataset splt info: The dataset is split into 80% of training set and 20% into testing set

E] Approach: 1) Finding Appropriate Dataset for the Problem Statement
          2) importing required libraries
          3) Cleaning Data and checking for null values
          4) Splitting dataset into training and testing set
          5) Finding dependent and independent   
          6) filtering the data to remove numeric charectors from data also removing stopwords
          7) Applying TfidfVectorizer to make text data into vectors
          8) defining naive Bayes model
          9) testing model 
          10) defining my function to test model to predict
